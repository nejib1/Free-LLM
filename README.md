# Free-LLM — Open Directory of Free AI & LLM APIs

**Stop paying for AI.** This project indexes every provider that lets you use large language models at zero cost — whether through permanent free tiers, trial credits, or local execution on your own hardware.

---

## Why This Exists

The LLM landscape changes weekly. New providers launch free tiers, others sunset theirs, rate limits shift overnight. Keeping track manually is painful. Free-LLM solves this by maintaining a **single source of truth** covering 45+ providers, continuously updated by the community.

```python
# Works with Groq, Cerebras, Grok, Together, DeepSeek, SambaNova...
# Just swap the base_url and api_key.

from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://api.groq.com/openai/v1"  # or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What makes LPU inference fast?"}]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

Most providers listed here support the **OpenAI SDK** — meaning you can switch between them by changing two lines.
